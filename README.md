# irritating_platformer
This game was one of the first web projects I built in 2021, and it does not properly display the quality of my current code.

Some functionalities, like progress saving, only work if the project runs on a server.

The project has a custom game engine. You can create new levels by duplicating an HTML page in levels/ and changing the matrix argument of setBoard().
